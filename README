This repository contains code for a 2.12 team for their final project.

It includes the following files.
-Tunable_Model is an object for storing sample data and optimizing a model to fit that sample data
-Trajectory_Tracker is an object with a Tunable_Model that predicts when the path modeled by the Tunable_Model intersects some zone
-field.png is used as a demo in Tunable_Model

In order to use it, you'll need NumPy and SciPy.
