# A TrajectoryTracker an object that predicts the motion of a physical
# object, such as a ball, and that can predict the arrival of that object
# into some zone. To accomplish this, a Trajectory_Tracker includes some
# tunable model for the general motion for the object as well as a
# geometric representation of the arrival area. Consequently, it can
# predict the time of arrival of the object as well as its exact
# coordinates upon arrive in the space. This could be used for estimating
# time to a collision or for estimating time for an uncontrolled object
# to arrive within the workspace of a robot.
